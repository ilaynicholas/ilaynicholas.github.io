			<p>My favorite CMSC subject so far would be CMSC 22 Object-Oriented Programming mainly because creating our project was fun and fulfilling to see the final product.</p>
			<p>My favorite GE subject so far would be MATH 10 Mathematics, Culture and Society because it is similar to CMSC 56, only easier and less stressful.</p>
			<p>My favorite programming language would be Java. Its OOP approach is very interesting and it makes creating projects and applications easier.</p>
			<p>My favorite food would be anything without a large amount of vegetables in it.</p>
